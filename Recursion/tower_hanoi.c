// to perform tower of hanoi using recursion 
/*
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk*/

		tower(n-1,A,C,B);
		printf("(%d,%d)\n",A,C);
		tower(n-1,B,A,C);
	}
}
